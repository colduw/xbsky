# xbsky
A basic Bluesky embedder (primarily for Discord), written in Go

# Usage
Append `x` before `bsky.app` -> `xbsky.app`

Want the raw/direct media only?
Append `raw` before `xbsky.app` -> `raw.xbsky.app`

# Notes
- If a post has multiple images, and raw media is used, only the first image will be shown (for now)
- This project was done as practice, if you encounter any bugs, errors, or whatnot, feel free to reach out to me
