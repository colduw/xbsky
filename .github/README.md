# xbsky
A simple Bluesky embedder for Telegram and Discord, written in Go

# Usage
Add an `x` before `bsky.app`, so it becomes `xbsky.app`

### Want the raw/direct media only?

Add `raw` before `xbsky.app`, so it becomes `raw.xbsky.app`

### A post has multiple images, but you want a combined one?

Add `mosaic` before `xbsky.app`, so it becomes `mosaic.xbsky.app`
